# Assignment

Unzip the assignment and install the required packages:

    $ unzip week3.zip
    $ cd week3
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you didn't get `pip` to work, you have several options:

1. fix pip
2. install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` using `apt-get` or `brew`
3. install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), a Python distribution that already includes all required packages.

## Open the notebook

Once everything is installed, start the Jupyter notebook as follows:

    $ jupyter notebook

This should open a browser with the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the directory with this assignment, and open the `.ipynb` notebook for this assignment.

Follow the instructions in the notebook. When you are done, save your work and close the notebook.

Finally, commit your work, push it to your repository, and submit the URL of your repository to Nestor. Do NOT forget this step!

This week there are no tests, because the assignment is about exploratory data analysis. However, naturally, correctness is still crucial!

Good luck!
